Our project can be run on VS Code browser or desktop version. 
Running "cd" --> "cd cs50project/teachtoachieve" --> "flask run" --> clicking on the given link will take you to our website.

]The homepage of our website displays our slogan, a brief description of the purpose of the site, and some simple instructions on how to utilize the site. Our website is based on the idea that students who are able to teach what they have learned show improved understanding and knowledge retention. Using our website, teachers can upload concepts and students can upload videos of themselves teaching the concept.

The navbar in the top right of the page has links to the register and login pages.
To create an account, go to the register page.
First, register as a teacher by creating a unique username and password, confirming the password, and selecting "teacher" from the dropdown menu.
If this is done correctly, you will be redirected to the login page. 

Use the same teacher username and password to log in, and you will be redirected to the teacher page.
This is where you can add concepts or assignment topics for students to view and upload their work. 
To add a concept for students, type in the "Name of Concept" textbox and then click the "Add" button. If you are an Algebra teacher, examples of concepts you can include are "Factoring", "Systems of equations", etc. 
For your convenience, duplicate concepts cannot be posted (case insensitive and disregards spacing). 
All the concepts you post will appear on your teacher page as well as the student page under "Class concepts".
When a student uploads work, it will appear on the teacher page under "Uploaded content". 
You can log out of your account by clicking the "Logout" button at the top left of the page. 
This will redirect you back to the homepage.

Next, go to the register page again via the navbar link to create a student account.
Register as a student by creating a unique username and password, confirming the password, selecting "student" from the dropdown menu, and typing in the correct classroom code which is "3GR25Y" (as you saw displayed on the teacher page).
If this is done correctly, you will again be redirected to the login page. 

Use the same student username and password to log in, and you will be redirected to the student page.
This is where you can view the concepts posted by the teacher and upload your work via a URL link of a video.
To upload your work, paste the URL link in the "URL Address" textbox and then click the "Submit a Link!" button. 
For your convenience, duplicate URL links cannot be uploaded (case insensitive and disregards spacing). 
All the links that you upload will appear on your student page as well as the teacher page under "Uploaded content".

You can log out by clicking the "Logout" button at the top left of the page.
